# Reasoning
# =========
#
# Selection of Checks
# ------------------
#
# Selecting the following general purpose checks relevant for C code:
# - clang-analyzer-* ()
# - bugprone-*
# - readability-*
# - misc-*
#
# Additional checks for other languages or specific to projects/coding standards
# are not used, expected for the Linux kernel coding conventions, as the RIOT
# coding conventions builds upon the Linux coding conventions.
#
# Finally, the following checks are disabled:
# - bugprone-reserved-identifier:
#       Too many false positives, as check does not take `static` declaration
#       into account
# - bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters:
#       This cannot be avoided
# - bugprone-too-small-loop-variable:
#       Too many false positives
#
#
# Which Warnings to Raise to Errors
# ---------------------------------
#
# - bugprone-*:
#       Avoiding known pitfalls or explicitly adding a magic comment and a
#       reasoning for why sticking with a footgun should be doable
# - portability-*:
#       Porability issues bite us hard due to the wide varity of board,
#       toolchains, standard C libs, etc. we use. So we should avoid them
#       where possible
#
#
# Fine Tuning
# -----------
#
# - readability-function-cognitive-complexity.IgnoreMacros: 'true':
#       Otherwise the use of `DEBUG()...` will be penalized, even though it
#       helps both in debugging and to document the code.
#
# Warning
# -------
#
# This configuration file is rather new and may enable a few warnings with a
# low signal-to-noise ratio are may not enable checks that would be exteremely
# helpful. If you modify this file to improve your experience, please consider
# upstreaming the changes.
